# Prompt 07: Seed Sample Reports

## User Request

Can you add 3 dummy reports (the same as already used) to the database so we have sample data?

## Expected Outcome

- Database seeded with 3 sample reports
- Reports use environment variable values for IDs
- Sample names: "Sales Dashboard", "Customer Analytics", "Inventory Report"
- All reports point to same workspace and report (for demo purposes)

## Sample Data

1. Sales Dashboard
2. Customer Analytics  
3. Inventory Report

All using the same POWERBI_WORKSPACE_ID and POWERBI_REPORT_ID from environment variables.
